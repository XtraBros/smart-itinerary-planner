4, White Rhinoceros,place,all,"A huge animal that feeds exclusively on grass, the white rhino has a wide mouth shaped for ‘mowing’ short grass. Its square lips set it apart from the hook-lipped black rhino.

Like horses and tapirs, rhinos have a simple stomach. Bacteria in their digestive tract help them digest the 60-80kg of vegetation they eat a day.

Our rhinos are fed pellets and leaves on top of grass. Keepers scatter these on the ground to suit their grazing habits. Fruits are given as treats.","8:30am – 6:00pm

12,Asian Small-clawed Otter,place,all,"Our otters’ two-tiered exhibit is spread across an outdoor upper deck and an indoor viewing gallery. The terrain of the top tier is rocky — they build their dens and nest chambers beneath the boulders. Here, you’ll see them doing their laps in the stream, engaged in a game of tag or playing ‘juggle-the-pebble’. To view their underwater acrobatics, follow the footpath to the lower exhibit. Zoom in on their tiny ears and nostrils — the otters can close them while they swim.","8:30am – 6:00pm

14,Hamadryas Baboon,animal,all,"Hardy monkeys with a strong build and a dog-like snout, both males and females of this baboon species sport greyish-brown fur. The males develop a long, silvery mantle-like mane when they reach puberty. They are twice as big as the females. Males and females look so dissimilar that they have been thought to be of different species.

Pay these intelligent primates a visit at the Great Rift Valley exhibit. ","8:30am – 6:00pm
",6,103.793503,1.405566
15,Pygmy Hippo,animal,all,"To strip a tree of its young shoots, wild pygmy hippos would start at a twig’s base and pull it through the mouth like a leafy kebab, shaking the head throughout. They’d also stand on their hind legs to feed on ferns growing within palms. In Liberia, they are known to be partial to a small, vine-like herb known as ‘Deewinkon’. Sweet potato leaves, okra, cassava and rice seedlings from farms at the forest edge are eaten. In Sierra Leone, they also take fish from traps.","8:30am – 6:00pm
",14,103.793005,1.405227
16,Malayan Tiger,animal,all,"Tigers are at the apex of the food chain. These solitary hunters can handle animal prey up to a ton in weight. A healthy adult has the strength of 30 men!

Sadly, man has turned the tables on them. Mercilessly poached to satisfy the insatiable demand for tiger parts, wild tigers are being hunted to extinction. In 2012 alone, tiger parts from at least 22 tigers were seized in Kedah. NGOs continue to report snares and illegal camp sites, even in protected areas.","8:30am – 6:00pm
",14,103.793025,1.40475
17,Tree Kangaroo,animal,all,"A long time ago, kangaroos evolved from tree-dwelling marsupials, developing adaptations for living on the ground. Tree kangaroos broke off from their land cousins by going back to arboreal life.

Their forelimbs grew muscular, their feet broadened and their claws curved to help them climb. They usually take little hopping steps and are unable to move more than two ""kangaroo hops"" at a go. However, they can leap up to 15m from tree to ground and can even walk backwards!","8:30am – 6:00pm
",6,103.793279,1.40596
18,Lion,animal,all,"Lions live in social groups known as prides, made up of one or more mature males, several closely-related females and their young. Males roar and spray urine to advertise their territory to rivals. Females work in teams to take down prey, encircling the prey and blocking escape routes. The lionesses do most of the hunting but the dominant male gets the lion’s share. Only after he’s had his fill do the females have their turn. The young can only pick at the remains.","8:30am – 6:00pm
",3,103.794293,1.401672
19,Leopard,animal,all,"In the face of changing land-use, decreasing prey and human persecution, the leopard has persisted where other large predators have not. Found wherever there is food and cover, it quenches its thirst with moisture from ingested prey. Not a fussy eater, it tolerates human presence well. Keen of sight and hearing, the leopard is comfortable both in water and on trees. Yet, it is not invulnerable. In parts of its range, populations have plummeted by 80% or more.","8:30am – 6:00pm

20,Orangutan,animal,all,"Orangutans are apes. Unlike monkeys, they do not have a tail. Found in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra, they have special feet with long toes for grasping branches, and long limbs that can stretch out far so that they can move easily through the treetops.","8:30am – 6:00pm

21,Wild Africa,region,all,"Africa boasts a diverse range of habitats, from tropical rainforests to harsh deserts. The animals found there have adapted accordingly in no end of amazing ways. As a result, the continent counts among its endemic species the tallest, the fastest and the largest creatures on land.","8:30am – 6:00pm
",11,103.793744,1.403115
22,African Penguin,animal,all,"Like our fingerprints, each penguin's feather pattern is unique. The flecks across their white chests are a way to distinguish one penguin from another.

Each individual also has its own distinct calls. There are three different types of calls: a bray to attract a mate; the yell to defend their territory; and the haw, used by mates to locate each other.

You can tell if a penguin is angry by its body language too — chest puffed, wings back, beak forward and head bobbing.","8:30am – 6:00pm

23,Elephants of Asia,animal,all,"Built on the banks of the serene Seletar Reservoir, this exhibit is home to our herd of five female elephants. Nestled in this quiet nook of the Zoo, you can enjoy panoramic views of the reservoir while watching our elephants at play.

Play is not only fun but helps our elephants develop skill and strength. Enrichment devices like play logs and rubber balls challenge our elephants physically and stimulate them mentally. Gambir especially enjoys a round with a rubber ball.","8:30am – 6:00pm

24,Tortoise Shell-ter,animal,all,"The seven rock-walled enclosures that make up Tortoise Shell-ter were designed to provide the highest standards of animal welfare for our chelonian collection. To recreate the animals’ natural habitats, much thought went into planning and sourcing for the specific plants needed. Each climate-controlled micro-habitat comes replete with special lighting, heating with temperature gradient and humidity control, creating the ideal home away from home for their inhabitants.","8:30am – 6:00pm

25,Primate Kingdom,region,all,"So why is this exhibit called Primate Kingdom? Each primate species is designated its own ‘island’. Add to that a landscaping of trees, a surrounding moat and you get ‘castles’ in which our furry rulers dwell. Here, our primates need not be king of the jungle to rule their own kingdom!","8:30am – 6:00pm
",12,103.794744,1.405259
26,Ring-tailed Lemur,animal,all,"In the wild, ring-tails live in matriarchal social groups of up to 30 individuals. Females stay with their troop their whole lives. Hierarchy is typically established in their youth through play-fighting. Males are completely dominated by the females — even the lowliest female is superior to the highest-ranked male.","8:30am – 6:00pm
",15,103.795256,1.402397
27,Grey Kangaroo,animal,all,"One of the largest kangaroo species, the eastern grey kangaroo swims well and evades predators, like dingoes, by diving. When cornered, it may turn the tables to hold the predators underwater and drown them.","8:30am – 6:00pm

29,Cheetah,animal,all,"A supple spine, long limbs, protruding claws and ridges on its footpads aid the cheetah in achieving a top speed of up to 115km/h. It can keep this up for all of 20 seconds and no more than 400m, so it approaches to within 30m of its quarry before its final attack. When it gets within striking distance, it trips its prey over with a sideways stroke of its forepaw or brings it down from the rear using its dewclaw (extra sharp claw on the inside of the foreleg).","8:30am – 6:00pm

30,Zebra,animal,all,"The largest of all zebras, the Grevy's zebra is named after former President of France, Jules Grévy, who received a zebra as a gift from the King of Abyssinia (present-day Ethiopia) in 1882. A French zoologist discovered it was distinct species in itself and named it after President Grevy.

Stallions of this species mark and maintain territories using middens (dung piles). The Grevy's zebra is distinguished from other zebras by its round ears, white underbelly and the bullseye stripe pattern on its rump.","8:30am – 6:00pm

31,Estuarine Crocodile,animal,all,"With only the nostrils, eyes and part of the back exposed, it’s hard to spot these crocs when they’re on the hunt. Once in range of their prey, they lunge out of the water and slam their jaws shut on it. The force of this alone usually kills its prey instantaneously - these crocs have the strongest bite force of all animals. If the prey is too big, the crocs grips it with their jaws and tear chunks off by spinning and twisting - a behaviour also known as the ‘death roll’.","8:30am – 6:00pm

Fallen tree trunks and overhanging forest vines are purposefully placed around the area to enhance this primate ‘playground’.

Given the high intelligence of chimpanzees (they possess over 98% of the genetic blueprint of humans), we strive to provide ample opportunities for our chimps to exercise and enjoy themselves.","8:30am – 6:00pm

38,Regal Horned Lizard,animal,all,"This lizard wears a ‘crown’ of thorny horns made up of four large horns at the back of its head and six smaller ones on the temples. Another distinguishing characteristic is the row of keeled scales on its abdomen.

When threatened, the lizard may try to divert its enemy’s attention with head-bobbing, push-ups, and nodding. If these fail, it rolls over, displaying its pale belly and splaying its short, white legs out stiffly. Some believe it’s only playing dead. Others think this action focuses a predator’s attention on the lizard’s spiky fringes — which look rather like sharp, serrated teeth — and advertises its unappetising spininess.","8:30am – 6:00pm
",17,103.794837,1.402853
39,Gaboon Viper,animal,all,"Like other vipers, the Gaboon viper has a thick body, keeled scales and triangular head. With hinged fangs at length of up to 5cm at the front of the mouth, these vipers have the longest fangs of any venomous snake. Weighing more than 20 kg and growing to lengths of more than 1.8 m, Gaboon vipers are also the largest vipers in Africa. The biggest individuals have heads that measure nearly 15 cm across at their widest point. Their symmetrical and striking pattern helps them blend seamlessly into the leaf litter on the forest floor. Its broad, whitish-cream head imitates a fallen leaf perfectly, right down to the dark central vein.","8:30am – 6:00pm

42,Aldabra Giant Tortoise,animal,all,"This species is found naturally on three of the islets of the Aldabra Atoll, a small group of coral islands. Over 90% of the population is found on the largest islet of Grande-Terre and the tortoises here are highly sociable compared to those on the other islets.

Water scarcity and inadequate food on Grande-Terre have inhibited the growth of individual tortoises. They should be ready to mate at 20 to 30 years of age but many do not reach sexual maturity.

44,Rabbit,animal,all,"Long movable ears and large eyes placed high on the head, providing near-360° vision, help rabbits detect predators from afar. Powerful hind-limbs help them make a quick getaway. The 80 or so breeds of domestic rabbits come in all colours and sizes. Well-loved for their gentle temperament, they make popular pets. They are social creatures that typically enjoy the company of other rabbits and even other pet animals like cats. Rabbits communicate using scent cues and touch. Though generally quiet, they may emit loud screams when alarmed or injured. They drum their hind limbs on the ground as a warning when they feel threatened.","8:30am – 6:00pm

Red pandas are solitary, just like giant pandas. Similarly, females are only fertile for a couple of days a year and males seek them out only around this time. Despite the difference in size in the adults, newborn red pandas weigh 100g, as heavy as panda cubs at birth.","8:30am – 6:00pm
